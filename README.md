Since a half past year when I started to re-learn about coding, I'm discovering some JS frameworks. This is a job that I was developing after I did my first )project?(, an explicit Vue Simulator through the front-end, showing highly accurated results and providing interactive data-binding, but not storage at all.

After that, I began a journey through documentation, and I made this, with these dependencies:

    "bcryptjs": "^2.4.3",
    "cloudinary": "^1.13.2",
    "connect-flash": "^0.1.1",
    "cookie-parser": "^1.4.4",
    "cross-env": "^5.2.0",
    "dotenv": "^6.2.0",
    "express": "^4.16.4",
    "express-handlebars": "^3.0.2",
    "express-session": "^1.15.6",
    "fs-extra": "^7.0.1",
    "handlebars-intl": "^1.1.2",
    "method-override": "^3.0.0",
    "mongoose": "^5.4.11",
    "morgan": "^1.9.1",
    "multer": "^1.4.1",
    "nodemailer": "^5.1.1",
    "passport": "^0.4.0",
    "passport-local": "^1.0.0",
    "xoauth2": "^1.2.0"
    
 
 # NEXT STEPS
Of course, this project was deprecated, by now. One of the biggest things to do is to create a GET-POST multi image reader, and get the stored objects with image arrays. From Oct to Dec 2018, time when I didnt know about github! That was a darkly time, with some 'index_25.html' or the real 'indexDEF.html', for real. Git and Github are amazing!
